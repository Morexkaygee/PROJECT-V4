# Student Dashboard Fix

## Issue Identified
The "Failed to load dashboard data" error is caused by:

1. **Authentication working correctly** - Login endpoint `/auth/login/student` works
2. **Profile API returning 500 error** - `/students/profile` has a server-side bug
3. **Courses API working correctly** - `/courses/student` returns data

## Working Login Credentials
- **Matric Number**: TEST/2024/001
- **Password**: test123

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Use the working test account
1. Go to the login page
2. Enter matric number: `TEST/2024/001`
3. Enter password: `test123`
4. Click login

### Step 2: If you want to use your actual account (IFT/19/0644)
The password for your account needs to be set/reset. You can either:
1. Ask the system administrator for the password
2. Reset it in the database
3. Create a new account with known credentials

### Step 3: Fix the Profile API Error (for developers)
The `/students/profile` endpoint is returning a 500 error. This needs to be investigated in the backend logs.

## Temporary Workaround
I've updated the frontend code to:
1. Add better error logging (check browser console)
2. Handle API errors more gracefully
3. Show specific error messages
4. Add connection status checking

## Next Steps
1. Try logging in with the test credentials above
2. Check browser console (F12) for detailed error messages
3. If still having issues, check if backend server is running
4. Look at backend server logs for the 500 error details
